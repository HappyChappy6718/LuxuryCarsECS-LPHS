                            Mercedes is a very high end car company, 
                            having prices that range from their cheepest 
                            2019 models starting at $33,950 to their most 
                            expensive 2019 models starting at $53,700.

                            Bugatis might be one of the most expensive 
                            cars on the market, because of the fact that 
                            the brands basic model even costs roughly 3 
                            million dollars, which is more expensive than 
                            the most expensive model of most cars on the 
                            market, and their most expensive one costing 
                            almost 19 million dollars.

                            the way up to around $308,00 which is very 
                            expensive and is definitely on the high end
